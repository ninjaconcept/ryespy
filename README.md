listener.

Ryespy provides an executable for listening to IMAP mailboxes, FTP folders,
Amazon S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage buckets, Google Drive accounts, or
Rackspace Cloud Files containers, keeps track of what it's seen using
Redis, and writes Sidekiq/Resque-compatible payloads.

Ryespy was inspired by [Redimap](https://github.com/tiredpixel/redimap).
Yes, it's sometimes possible to inspire oneself. Ryespy with my little eye.

## Externals

## Installation

Install using:

    gem install ryespy

Listener dependencies are required dynamically. That means that it may be
necessary to manually install the indicated gems if you are using that listener.
If you are not using that listener, the dependencies need not be installed.

### Amazon S3 Listener

    gem install fog -v '~> 1.19'

### Google Cloud Storage Listener

    gem install fog -v '~> 1.19'

### Google Drive Listener

    gem install google_drive -v '~> 0.3'

### Rackspace Cloud Files Listener

    gem install fog -v '~> 1.19'

The default Ruby version supported is defined in `.ruby-version`.
Any other versions supported are defined in `.travis.yml`.


## Usage

View the available options:

    ryespy --help

It is necessary to specify a listener and at least one notifier.
Currently, the only notifier is `--notifier-sidekiq`.

To run eternally, use `--eternal` (no need for Cron, but you can if you prefer).


### IMAP Listener

Check IMAP, queue new email UIDs, and quit:

    ryespy --listener imap --imap-host mail.example.com --imap-username a@example.com --imap-password helpimacarrot --notifier-sidekiq

For non-SSL, use `--no-imap-ssl`.
For non-INBOX or multiple mailboxes, use `--imap-mailboxes INBOX,Sent`.

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyIMAPJob
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(mailbox, uid)
      end
    end

### FTP Listener

Check FTP, queue new file paths, and quit:

    ryespy --listener ftp --ftp-host ftp.example.com --ftp-username b@example.com --ftp-password helpimacucumber --notifier-sidekiq

For PASSIVE mode, use `--ftp-passive`.
For non-root or multiple directories, use `--ftp-dirs /DIR1,/DIR2`.

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyFTPJob
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(dir, filename)
      end
    end

### Amazon S3 Listener

Check Amazon S3, queue new file keys, and quit:

    ryespy --listener amzn-s3 --amzn-s3-access-key c/example/com --amzn-s3-secret-key helpimabroccoli --amzn-s3-bucket vegetable-box --notifier-sidekiq

For non-* or multiple key prefix filters,
use `--amzn-s3-prefixes virtual-dir1/,virtual-dir`.

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyAmznS3Job
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(filename)
      end
    end

### Google Cloud Storage Listener

Check Google Cloud Storage, queue new file keys, and quit:

    ryespy --listener goog-cs --goog-cs-access-key d/example/com --goog-cs-secret-key helpimanasparagus --goog-cs-bucket vegetable-box --notifier-sidekiq

For non-* or multiple key prefix filters,
use `--goog-cs-prefixes virtual-dir1/,virtual-dir`.

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyGoogCSJob
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(filename)
      end
    end

### Google Drive Listener

*Note that the Google Drive listener currently has a pre-filter maximum of 1000
files. That means that having more files than this in an account is not (yet)
supported; such files might be ignored entirely, or strange behaviour might be
encountered depending on the order in which the files are returned.*
*<https://github.com/tiredpixel/ryespy/pull/2>*  
*<https://github.com/tiredpixel/ryespy/issues/3>*

Check Google Drive, queue new file resource ids, and quit:

    ryespy --listener goog-drv --goog-drv-username vegetable-box@gmail.com --goog-drv-password helpimgarlic --goog-drv-filters vegetable-box --notifier-sidekiq

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyGoogDrvJob
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(resource_id)
      end
    end

### Rackspace Cloud Files Listener

Check Rackspace Cloud Files, queue new file keys, and quit:

    ryespy --listener rax-cf --rax-cf-username vegetable --rax-cf-api-key helpimacelery --rax-cf-container vegetable-box --notifier-sidekiq

For non-DFW region, use `--rax-cf-region lon`.
For non-US auth endpoint, use `--rax-cf-endpoint uk`.
Is your Rackspace account in London? Fret not; combine these and
use `--rax-cf-endpoint uk --rax-cf-region lon`.
For non-* or multiple key prefix filters,
use `--rax-cf-prefixes virtual-dir1/,virtual-dir`.

#### Example Worker

    class RyespyRaxCFJob
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      sidekiq_options :queue => :ryespy
      
      def perform(filename)
      end
    end


## Advanced Usage

If you want to do something rather more magical such as checking multiple
accounts for a listener or even multiple listeners, then you may wish to use the
Ryespy library directly instead of the `ryespy` executable.

Depend upon the `ryespy` gem in a `Gemfile`, remembering to add any manual
dependencies for listeners as detailed in [Installation](#installation):

    # Gemfile
    
    gem 'ryespy'
    gem 'fog' # example manual dependency

Configure Ryespy Redis and require Ryespy:

    require 'redis'
    require 'redis/namespace'
    
    Redis.current = Redis::Namespace.new('ryespy',
      :redis => Redis.connect(:url => nil) # Redis default
    )
    
    require 'ryespy'

Create the notifiers:

    require 'ryespy/notifier/sidekiq'
    
    notifiers = []
    notifiers << Ryespy::Notifier::Sidekiq.new(
      :url       => nil, # Redis default
      :namespace => 'resque'
    )

For each listener, configure like in `ryespy --help` but without the prefix and
with `-` changed to `_` (e.g. `--amzn-s3-access-key` => `:access_key`). Pass in
an array of notifiers. Note that the `check()` argument varies per listener,
meaning IMAP mailbox, FTP directory, Google Drive filter, or storage key prefix.

    require 'ryespy/listener/amzn_s3'
    
    Ryespy::Listener::AmznS3.new(
      :access_key => 'ACCESS_KEY',
      :secret_key => 'SECRET_KEY',
      :bucket     => 'BUCKET',
      :notifiers  => notifiers
    ) do |listener|
      listener.check('prefix/')
    end

That's about the size of it.

## Contributions

Contributions are embraced with much love and affection!
Please fork the repository and wizard your magic, preferably with plenty of
fairy-dust sprinkled over the tests. ;)
Then send me a pull request. Simples!
If you'd like to discuss what you're doing or planning to do, or if you get
stuck on something, then just wave. :)

Do whatever makes you happy. We'll probably still like you. :)

Tests are written using [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest),
which is included by default in Ruby 1.9 onwards. To run all tests:

    rake test

When using the `ryespy` executable in development, you'll probably want to set
`--debug` mode so debug-level messages are logged and stack traces raised.
